# Noxus

a hard modpack based off of the [nox](https://github.com/qxeii/nox-renoxed) mod. your goal should be defeating the ender dragon, but let's be honest here; the real goal is to survive for as long as you can. the pack is themed around vanilla with a lot of cool qol, tweaks, and fun stuff while still being utterly ruthless. have fun, i recommend playing this pack with friends!

> ## ![NoxusDev](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9168718-0a95-4de8-8f8d-31bbd90f5a4b) some notable things:

- [you have 10 lives total](https://github.com/iChun/LimitedLives). if you lose a life, you lose a starting heart (e.g. you have 20hp/10hearts when you spawn, if you die you'll respawn with 18hp/9hearts). the more you die, the weaker you become. if you lose all 10 lives, you won't be able to respawn; automatically being put into spectator mode. so uh... don't die. 
- [there's a 'bleeding' mechanic](https://github.com/Xires87/Haemorrhage), try not taking any mob damage unless you're packin' bandages. there are also some new negative effects, such as 'broken' and 'health loss' that can be cured through splints and herbal balms or honey bottles.
- **you cannot recover health by normal means**, saturation does not heal you!!! you have to heal mainly through either first aid items (bandages, herbal balms, etc.) or by sleeping. there are some more cool alternative ways too that you can discover.
- blood moons exist, be wary.
- stone tools are actually stone tools now (you'll find out lol).
- diamond armor and tools are no longer craftable. they now require a smithing table with their iron counterparts and a **one-use** diamond smithing template.
- [armor is nerfed](https://github.com/ryleu/armor-nerf). leather, gold, and chainmail armor have all been reworked for more 'unique' use-cases.
- villager trades are nerfed. diamond trades are no longer enchanted. armorer no longer trades diamond chestplates or leggings.
- [enchanting is reworked](https://github.com/Akinesis/better-enchanting). enchanting as a mechanic now has more freedom; you can actually select your enchantments in the enchanting table! however, on-top of lapis and xp, each enchantment now needs a unique item that's been tailored for it. obtaining stronger enchantments will require some unique items that are more expensive or tedious to craft.

sidenote: **don't play on hardcore**, it's not the intended experience!!! the difficulty should only be on hard, but you can play on normal or easy too if you're a wuss.
