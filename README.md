# Noxus

a hard modpack based off of the [nox](https://github.com/qxeii/nox-renoxed) mod. the goal is to beat the game, but the most relatable objective is to just survive as long as you can. the idea is that this pack is run-based, you can (and most likely will) lose! in fact, you're going to die a lot. the pack is themed around vanilla with some cool qol, optimizations, tweaks, and fun stuff while still being utterly ruthless. have fun, i recommend playing this pack with friends!

> ## ![NoxusDev](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9168718-0a95-4de8-8f8d-31bbd90f5a4b) some notable things:

- **[you have 10 lives total](https://github.com/iChun/LimitedLives)**. everytime you die you lose a starting heart on respawn (e.g. 10 -> 9). meaning the more you die, the weaker you become. if you lose all 10 lives, you won't be able to respawn; automatically being put into spectator mode. so uh... don't die.
- **you cannot recover health by normal means**, saturation is no longer tied to healing. you must find other ways to heal (potions, bandages, sleeping, etc.).
  - [there's also a "bleeding" mechanic](https://github.com/Xires87/Haemorrhage), try not taking any mob damage unless you're packin' bandages. there are also some new negative effects, such as "broken" and "health loss" that can be cured through splints, herbal balms, or honey bottles.
- [lunar events](https://github.com/Mrbysco/Lunar) such as blood moons exist, be wary.
- progression has been slighty reworked:
  - **logs and planks need an axe to be harvestable.** break leaves to obtain sticks or saplings (which you can turn into sticks) to turn into planks in order to craft wooden tools.
  - wooden tools are pocket-sized now! you can easily craft all variations of them in your 2x2 crafting grid.
  - stone tools are actually stone tools now (you'll find out lol).
  - **diamond armor and tools are no longer craftable**. they now require a smithing table with their iron counterparts and a **one-use** diamond smithing template.
- **[armor is nerfed](https://github.com/ryleu/armor-nerf)**. leather, gold, and chainmail armor have all been reworked for more 'unique' use-cases.
- **villager trades are nerfed**. diamond trades are no longer enchanted. armorer no longer trades diamond chestplates or leggings.
- **[enchanting is reworked](https://github.com/Akinesis/better-enchanting)**. enchanting as a mechanic now has more freedom; you can actually select your enchantments in the enchanting table! however, enchantments now have items tailored for them that can be tedious or expensive to craft/obtain.

sidenote: **don't play on hardcore**, it's not the intended experience!!! the difficulty should only be on hard, but you can play on normal or easy too if you're a wuss.
