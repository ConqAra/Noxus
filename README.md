# Noxus
a hard modpack based off of the nox mod. you have 10 lives total. if you lose a life, you lose a starting heart (e.g. you have 20hp/10hearts when you spawn, if you die you'll respawn with 18hp/9hearts). the more you die, the weaker you become. if you lose all 10 lives, you'll be put in spectator mode (meaning you're dead dead!). so uh... don't die. your goal should be defeating the ender dragon, but let's be honest here; the real goal is to survive for as long as you can. the pack is themed around vanilla with a lot of cool qol, tweaks, and fun stuff while still being utterly ruthless. have fun, i recommend playing this pack with friends!
