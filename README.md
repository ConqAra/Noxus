# Noxus
a hard modpack based off of the nox mod. you have 10 lives total. if you lose a life, you lose a starting heart (e.g. you have 20hp/10hearts when you spawn, if you die you'll respawn with 18hp/9hearts). the more you die, the weaker you become. if you lose all 10 lives, you won't be able to respawn; automatically being put into spectator mode. so uh... don't die. your goal should be defeating the ender dragon, but let's be honest here; the real goal is to survive for as long as you can. the pack is themed around vanilla with a lot of cool qol, tweaks, and fun stuff while still being utterly ruthless. have fun, i recommend playing this pack with friends!
note: don't play on hardcore, it's not the intended experience!!! the difficulty should only be on hard, but you can play on normal or easy too if you're a wuss.
